/*
This file is where most of your code changes will occur
You will write the code to retrieve information from the database, or save
information to the database

The class has several hard coded static variables used for the connection, you
will need to change those to your connection information

This class also has static string variables for pickup, delivery and dine-in.
If your database stores the strings differently (i.e "pick-up" vs "pickup")
changing these static variables will ensure that the comparison is checking for
the right string in other places in the program. You will also need to use these
strings if you store this as boolean fields or an integer.

        A function to get the list of toppings and their inventory levels. I
        have left this code "complete" as an example of how to use JDBC to get
        data from the database. This query will not work on your database if you
        have different field or table names, so it will need to be changed

        Also note, this is just getting the topping ids and then calling
        getTopping() to get the actual topping. You will need to complete this
        on your own

        You don't actually have to use and write the getTopping() function, but
        it can save some repeated code if the program were to expand, and it
        keeps the functions simpler, more elegant and easy to read. Breaking up
        the queries this way also keeps them simpler. I think it's a better way
        to do it, and many people in the industry would agree, but its a
        suggestion, not a requirement.

	Note: The following incomplete functions are not strictly required, but could make your DBNinja class much simpler. For instance, instead of writing one query to get all of the information about an order, you can find the primary key of the order, and use that to find the primary keys of the pizzas on that order, then use the pizza primary keys individually to build your pizzas. We are no longer trying to get everything in one query, so feel free to break them up as much as possible

	You could also add functions that take in a Pizza object and add that to the database, or take in a pizza id and a topping id and add that topping to the pizza in the database, etc. I would recommend this to keep your addOrder function much simpler

	These simpler functions should still not be called from our menu class. That is why they are private
